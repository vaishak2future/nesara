<p><em>7. Saline-Alkaline soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>They show white incrustation of salts of Calcium, Magnesium and Sodium on the surface.</li>
    <li>These are poor in drainage and are infertile.</li>
    <li>In regions with low water table, the salts percolate into sub-soil and in regions with good drainage, the salts are wasted away by flowing water.</li>
    <li>But in places where the drainage system is poor, the water with high salt concentration becomes stagnant and deposits all the salts in the top soil as it evaporates.</li>
    <li>In regions with high sub-soil water table, injurious salts are transferred from below by the capillary action as a result of evaporation in dry season.</li>
