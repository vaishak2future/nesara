    <p><em>4. Laterite soils (Oxisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Laterite soils are mostly the end products of weathering, formed under high temperatures and high rainfall with alternate wet and dry periods.</li>
    <li>Laterite soils are red in color due to little clay and more gravel of red sand-stones.</li>
    <li>Lime and Silica are leached away in heavy rainfall, but the soil is rich in oxides of Iron and Aluminium compounds.</li>
    <li>They are very poor in lime, Magnesium, Potash and Nitrogen.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, the Phosphate content may be high in the form of Iron Phosphate.</li>
    <li>Laterite soils lack fertility due to intensive leaching.</li>
    <li>When manured and irrigated, some laterites are suitable for growing plantation crops like Tea, Coffee, Rubber, Cinchona, Coconut, Arecanut, etc.</li>
</ul></p>
