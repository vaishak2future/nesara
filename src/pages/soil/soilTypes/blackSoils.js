    <p><em>2. Black soils (Vertisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>A typical black soil has a high clay content of 62% or more.</li>
    <li>The black soils have high moisture retention capacity, and are generally neutral to slightly alkaline.</li>
    <li>When dry, soil shrinks and develops deep cracks permitting oxygenation of the soil to sufficient depths and thus enhancing fertility.</li>
    <li>The black colour is due to the presence of a small proportion of Titaniferous Magnetite or Iron and black constituents of the parent rock.</li>
    <li>They generally contain 10% Alumina, 9-10% Iron Oxide, 6-8% lime and Magnesium Carbonates, less than 0.5% Potash and are low in Phosphates, Nitrogen and humus.</li>
    <li>This soil has been used for growing a variety of crops for centuries without adding fertilizers and manures.</li>
</ul></p>
