    <p><em>8. Peaty and Marshy soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>These types of soils are found in coastal tracts.</li>
    <li>Accumulation of partly decayed organic matter over several years in the presence of high moisture gives rise to peaty and marshy soils.</li>
    <li>These are black in colour, heavy and highly acidic.</li>
    <li>When properly drained and fertilized, these soils produce good crops of rice.</li>
