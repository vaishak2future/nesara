<p><em>6. Arid-Desert soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The desert soils consist of sand (90 - 95%) and clay (5 - 10%).</li>
    <li>They are usually poor in organic matter.</li>
    <li>Some desert soils are alkaline with varying degree of soluble salts like Calcium carbonate.</li>
    <li>Calcium content increases downwards with the subsoil having ten times more Calcium.</li>
    <li>The Phosphate content of these soils is as high as in normal alluvial soils.</li>
    <li>Nitrogen is originally low but some of it is available in the form of Nitrates.</li>
    <li>Phosphates and Nitrates make these soils fertile wherever moisture is available.</li>
    <li>There is a possibility of reclaiming these soils if proper irrigation facilities are available.</li>
</ul></p>
