    <p><em>3. Red soils (Alfisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The main parent rocks are crystalline and metamorphic rocks.</li>
    <li>The red colour is due to the presence of oxides of Iron.</li>
    <li>The texture of these soils can vary from sand to clay, the majority being loams.</li>
    <li>On the uplands, the red soils are poor, gravelly and porous.</li>
    <li>But in the lower areas they are rich, deep dark and fertile.</li>
    <li>They are mostly acidic and are poor in lime, Magnesium, Phosphates, Nitrogen and humus.</li>
    <li>They are fairly rich in Potassium.</li>
    <li>The red soils are mostly loamy and hence cannot retain water unlike the black soils.</li>
</ul></p>
