    <p><em>1. Alluvial soils (Entisols)</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>These are most important from agriculture point of view.</li>
    <li>Alluvial soils are formed mainly due to silt deposited by rivers.</li>
    <li>In coastal regions, some alluvial deposits are formed due to wave action.</li>
    <li>The parent material of these soils is of transported origin.</li>
    <li>The soil is porous because it has about equal proportions of sand and clay (loamy), but clayey soils are not uncommon.</li>
    <li>While they are generally low in Nitrogen, the proportion of Potash, Phosphoric Acid and alkalies are adequate.</li>
    <li>They are best suited to irrigation and respond well to canal and well/tube-well irrigation.</li>
</ul></p>
