    <p><em>5. Forest-Mountain soils</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>They are mainly heterogeneous soils found on the hill slopes covered by forests.</li>
    <li>The formation of these soils is mainly governed by the characteristic deposition of organic matter derived from forests and their character changes with parent rocks, ground-configuration and climate.</li>
    <li>The forest soils are very rich in humus and are mostly acidic.</li>
    <li>They are deficient in Potash, Phosphorus and lime.</li>
    <li>They require good deal of fertilizers for high yields.</li>
    </ul></p>
