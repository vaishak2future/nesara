    <ControlledCarousel/>
    <p>Man cannot exist without soil.</p>
<p>Soil may be defined as a thin layer of earth crust that supports growth of land plants.</p>
<p>Soil is a living body full of activity rather than just an inert mixture of sand and clay.</p>
<p>Soils consist of minerals, organic materials and differ in morphology, physical make-up, chemical composition and biological characteristics.</p>
<p>Soil provides plants the physical support and meets their needs of water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Soils need to be scientifically managed forsustained crop production over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Soil properties decide the nature of conversion, conservation of nutrients, and how they are made available to the plants.</p>

<p><em>Green manuring & Green leaf manuring</em></p>

<p>
    Green manuring is an efficient way of increasing organic matter in the soil. 
    It is the practice of growing plants usually belonging to leguminous family
    and incorporating them into the soil after sufficient growth. An ideal green manure crop should be
    inexpensive to plant, easily to establish, produce succulent tops and roots rapidly, 
    generate good ground cover quickly and capable of growing on poor soils.
    These crops should be tilled in to the ground at flowering stage. The most important green manure
    crops are Sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea), Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeate), Clusterbeans (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba), Pillipesara (Phaseolus trilobus) and
    Sesbania rostrata (stem nodulating). Soil organic matter can also be increased by incorporating green leaves and twigs
    collected from trees, shrubs and herbs grown elsewhere. This is called green leaf manuring. Some important species suitable for the
    purpose are Neem (Azadirachta indica), Mahua (Madhuca longifolia), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), Karanji (Pongamia glabra), Calotropis (Calotropis gigantea), Avise (Sesbania grandiflora), Subabul
    (Leucaena leucocephala). In addition to enhancing soil fertility, green manuring and green leaf manuring also improves soil structure, increases 
    water holding capacity and reduces soil erosion. Growing green manure crops reduces weed proliferation and helps in reclamation of alkaline soils.

<p><em>Jeevamrutha</em></p>
<p>Method of preparation: (for 1 acre)</p>
<p>Water - 200 - 250 ltr.</p>
<p>Cow dung - 10 - 15 kg.</p>
<p>Cow urine - 3 - 4 ltr.</p>
<p>Jaggery - 1 - 2 kg.</p>
<p>Flour of pulses - 2 kg.</p>
<p>Soil - 2 - 3 handfuls</p>
<p>(Collect soil from the same field from under a tree or un-disturbed
location).</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Mix above mentioned ingredients and keep under shade for 3-4 days.</li>    
    <li>Stir the mixture once a day.</li>
    <li>Apply Jeevamrutha to plants when the soil is wet.</li>
    <li>Though it can be used even after 6-7 days, it is difficult because of its overpowering stench, hence it is advised to use Jeevamrutha within 3-4 days of preparation.</li>
</ul></p> 

<p><strong>PROBLEM SOILS</strong></p>

<p>Soils that cannot be economically used for crop production without adopting reclamation measures are called Problem Soils.</p>

<p><em>Acid soils</em></p>
<p>Acid soils have a pH of less than 6.5 and
respond to liming. They are common in humid regions.
Leaching of certain nutrients like Ca, Mg.
etc., enhances development of soil acidity.
Soils developed from acidic rocks like granite
containing Silica are naturally acidic.
Decomposition of organic matter in soil
increases acidity due to production of a large
number of organic and inorganic acids.
Application of fertilizers like Ammonium
Sulphate, Urea, Ammonium Nitrate also
contribute to acidity.
Increased concentrations of Aluminium,
Manganese and Iron in acid soils adversely
affect plant growth and yield.
Plants suffer from Calcium, Magnesium and
Potassium deficiency in acid soils.
Rock Phosphate is an economical and better
suited source of Phosphorus in acid soils.
Muriate of Potash (MOP), which also tends
to increase the pH is a better source of
Potassium than Potassium Sulphate.
A large number of beneficial microorganisms
become inactive in acid soils thus slowing
down mineralization and nitrification.
It has toxic effect on root tissues and
adversely affects the permeability. It affects the availability of Copper and Zinc
and Phosphorus also gets immobilized. Plant diseases are more prevalent in acidic
soils.
</p>

<p>Reclamation of acid soils:</p>
<p>
Acid soils can be reclaimed by adding metals
like Calcium and Magnesium, a process called liming.
The most common liming materials used are Lime stone [CaCO3], Quick lime [CaO]
and Slaked lime [Ca(OH)2], Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2].Quantity of liming material depends on the
soil texture, with light soils requiring less than the heavy soils.
Requirement of liming material also depends on the pH and it may range from about 2
MT/acre for soils of pH 5.5 to as high as 4.8 MT/acre for soils of pH 3.5. 
Lime should be applied based on soil test reports because excessive liming leads to Fe,
Mn, Cu, Zn deficiency, decreased phosphate availability and Boron uptake. Lime should be applied at least one month
before cropping and mixed with soil by ploughing. Apply lime in small quantities every year or
once in two years. If the quantity is not more than 2 MT/acre, it can be applied in one dose.
</p>

<p><em>Dolomite</em></p>
<p>
    The most common liming materials used are Lime stone [CaCO3], Quick lime [CaO] and Slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]
    and Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. Dolomite is Calcium Magnesium bicarbonate [(CaMg(CO3)2]. When Magnesium is to be provided to a crop along with correcting the soil acidity, Dolomite is the right choice.
    Unlike Gypsum, which is added routinely in irrigated soils, Dolomite is to be used for correcting soil acidity.
    At higher soil pH values, the carbonate in limestone and dolomite will actually burn the crops, and even cause
    plant death in severe cases.
</p>

<p><strong>
    NOTE: Lime should never be applied with nitrogenous fertilizers and water soluble phosphatic fertilizers 
    since it leads to loss of nitrogen in the form of Ammonia and decreases availability of Phosphorus.
</strong></p>

<p><em>Saline Soils</em></p>

<p>Saline soils contain high percentages of
chloride and sulphate of Calcium and
Magnesium.
The pH of the soils is less than 8.5 and
Electric Conductivity is >4 decisiemens/m.
The exchangeable Sodium is less than 15%
of Base Exchange capacity of soils.
The osmotic pressure due to high
concentrations of soluble salts decreases
water availability to plants, through exosmosis, resulting in stunted growth and
retarded growth of leaves and stems.
In extreme cases it leads to plasmolysis.
Seed germination is also reduced.
High concentrations of Sodium and Sulphate
reduce absorption of Calcium leading to Ca
deficiency.
Saline soils are formed when salts that
result from weathering are not fully leached
especially in arid and semi-arid areas; due to
upward movement of salts from lower depths
during seasonal irrigation; due to irrigating
with saline water or ingress of sea water.
</p>

<p><em>Reclamation of Saline soils:</em></p>

<p>There are three ways of reclamation of saline
soils – Eradication, Conversions and
Control. Eradication involves repeated heavy
flooding and draining of the soils to effectively
leach out the soluble salts.
The field should be made into smaller plots to
hold irrigation water and flooded with good
quality water up to 15-20 cm and puddled.
The water is then removed through drainage
channels. The process should be repeated
5-6 times. Leaching should be done before application
of Gypsum. Scraping of surface salts also can be done
as a method of eradication, but is not very
efficient and is costly. Conversion involves using Gypsum to
displace Sodium with Calcium from the
exchangeable complex. Gypsum should be applied in powder form uniformly in the field and mixed by light
ploughing of the upper 6 - 8 cm soil. Control method involves retardation of
evaporation by mulching, deep chiseling of
soil to open the impervious layer to improve
water percolation and addition of organic
matter.</p>

<p><em>Alkali Soils</em></p>

<p>Alakali soils are low in permeability of water
and air, sticky when wet, hard on drying,
and thus not congenial for plant growth.
High percentage of Sodium decreases
absorption of Calcium and Magnesium by
the roots.
Solubility of Zinc and Iron is affected.
It may even cause lime induced Iron chlorosis.
Plants show restricted root system and
delayed flowering.
Leaf burn is common due to excess of
chloride and sodium.
Alkali soils are of two kinds. Saline-alkali
soils and Non-saline alkali soils.</p>
<p>Saline-alkali soils:</p>
<p>These soils are both saline and alkaline
and contain appreciable quantities of
neutral soluble salts.
While pH remains &lt8.5 and EC >4
decisiemens/m as in saline soils, unlike
in saline soils the exchangeable Sodium
is more than 15% of base exchange
capacity of soils.</p>

<p>Non-saline alkali soils (Black alkali soils):</p>

<p>These soils do not contain large quantities of neutral soluble salts, but 
    exchangeable Sodium is more than 15% of base exchange capacity of soils. Soil pH is >8.5 and EC &lt4 decisiemens/m.
    High Sodium content results in dispersal of clay and organic matter leading to close packing of soil particles and
    reduces pore space and aeration. Soil develops shallow cracks and surface soil becomes hard and compact. Water does not percolate quickly and remains muddy for a long time.
    Application of alkaline fertilizers like Sodium Nitrate, basic slag etc., also contribute to alkalinity.
</p>

<p>Reclamation of Alkali soils:</p>
<p>Eradication: Leaching with excessive
flooding and draining is done as in
reclamation of saline soils after conversion
of exchangeable Sodium into water soluble
form.</p>

<p>Conversion:</p>
<p>Gypsum</p>
<p>	 Large quantities of Gypsum are applied
to replace Sodium and leach it downward
and out of reach of plant roots. Gypsum reacts with Sodium Carbonate
and adsorbed Sodium to produce Sodium
Sulphate, which dissolves in water and is
leached away. Dosage of Gypsum ranges from 800 kg/
acre in soils of pH 7.4 to 7.8 to as high
as 5.7 MT/acre for soils of pH above 9.0. Gypsum can be applied in one dose if the
requirement is below 3 MT/acre; in two
doses if it is between 3 and 5 MT and
three doses if it exceeds 5 MT. </p>

<p>Sulphur:</p>
<p>In extreme cases ground Sulphur is
incorporated into the soil several weeks
before planting of the crop.
In case of soils of pH 8.0, up to 2.50 MT
Sulphur and 5-7.5 MT of organic matter
per acre, is required to reduce the pH to
about 6.5.</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid:</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid may directly be used when
alkalinity is very high.
However, the method is expensive and
hazardous.</p>
<p>Lime or Lime sulphur: </p>
<p>Calcium Carbonate replacing Na+ in soil
colloid with Ca2+.</p>

<p>Ferrous Sulphate and soluble salts of
Aluminium: </p>
<p>These bring down alkalinity by formation
of Sulphuric acid resulting in production
of leachable Calcium Sulphate.</p>
<p>Mollases:</p>
<p>Mollases (2 MT/acre) and press mud (1
MT/acre) are also effective in reclamation
of alkali soils through production of
organic acid.</p>
<p>Organic manures: </p>
<p>Organic manures bring down the pH
through production of carbonic acid in
the soil, which solubilizes Calcium salts. Microbial activity in organic manure
also stimulates oxidation of Sulphur to
Sulphate form.</p>

<p>Mulching:</p>
<p>Mulching improves physical and microbial
properties, prevents crust formation,
disrupts capillary continuity, reduces
water loss through evaporation and
prevents accumulation of salts on soil
surface.</p>

<p>Fertilizer management in Saline and
Alkali soils</p>
<p>Fertilizers of acidic nature are advised for
alkali soils and Ammoniacal fertlizers are
useful in saline soils.
Due to decreased availability and leaching
of chemical fertilizers, generally 50% higher
dose of Nitrogen and Phosphorus are
recommended.
Application of Zinc Sulphate and Gypsum is
very essential in alkaline soils.
Organic manures have been observed to
be better than inorganic fertilizers in both
saline and alkali soils.
Dhaincha (Sesbania aculata) is an important
source of green manure in reclamation of
alkali soils.
Green manuring with Dhaincha along with
Gypsum is effective in restoring physical
condition and enriching the soil in nitrogen
and organic matter.</p>

<p>Gypsum - The versatile soil amendment</p>
<p>Gypsum is the most versatile soil amendment that has many uses especially in irrigated soils. 
    Gypsum being Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4.2H2O) is a key ingredient for maintenance of irrigated
    soils that would gradually turn saline or alkaline.
    Calcium in Gypsum replaces Sodium in sodic soils and helps in leaching it as Sodium Sulphate.
    In addition to preventing and correcting sodicity, Gypsum affords stability of soil organic
    matter, stable soil aggregates, improved water penetration and helps rapid seed emergence.
    It helps in breaking up compact soil, especially in combination with organic amendments.
    Gypsum rapidly decreases the pH of sodic soils.
    Gypsum improves the ability of soil to drain and not become waterlogged due to a combination
    of high sodium, swelling clay, and excess water.
    Gypsum provides Calcium, which is a major mechanism that binds soil organic matter to clay
    giving stability to soil aggregates.
    In combination with lime, it decreases leaching losses of Potassium and Magnesium.
    Gypsum increases water-use efficiency by improving water infiltration rates, hydraulic
    conductivity and better water storage in the soil leading to deeper rooting and better wateruse efficiency.
    It provides Calcium that is essential for the biochemical mechanisms by which most plants nutrients are absorbed by roots.
    Calcium in Gypsum regulates the balance of micronutrients, such as Iron, Zinc, Manganese
    and Copper, in plants. Calcium prevents excess uptake of many of them; and once they are in the plant, Calcium
    keeps them from having adverse effects when their levels get high.
    Application of Gypsum is essential for good fruit quality, especially in very high pH soils where adequate Calcium is not available.
    Gypsum helps prevent blossom-end rot of Watermelon and Tomatoes and bitter pit in Apples.
    Gypsum is preferred over lime for management of scab in Potatoes grown in acid soils.
    Root rot of Avocado trees caused by Phytophthora is partially corrected by Gypsum and organics.
    Gypsum decreases volatilization loss of Ammonium Nitrogen from applications of Ammonia, Ammonium Nitrate, Urea, Ammonium
    Sulfate, or any of the Ammonium Phosphates.</p>

<p><strong>SOIL TESTING</strong></p>
<p>Soil looses a considerable amount of its
nutrients due to uptake by plants, through
leaching and erosion. Continued maintenance of a high level of
soil fertility is indispensable for sustained agricultural production. From time to time the inherent fertility of
soil has to be evaluated. Soil test information along with knowledge
of specific crop requirements, cropping history and physical characteristics of the
soil help in determining the exact amounts of different nutrients and soil amendments,
if any, needed for a certain crop or cropping sequence. </p>

<p><em>Soil Sampling</em></p>
<p>Soil sample should be properly collected and be representative of the area to be tested.
    Avoid drawing samples from old bunds, marshy spots, hedges, areas previously occupied by compost heaps, etc.
    Do not sample in a field within three months
    of the application of lime, ash or fertilizer. 
    Where crops have been planted collect samples between plants and lines.
    To get representative samples, collect soil from at least 10 to 15 places randomly
    spread over the field. Scrape away the surface of the randomly
    selected points to remove weeds and litter. Dig pits of 6” x 6” or a ‘V’ shaped pit of 1
    ft. deep or collect samples of 0- 6”and 6-12” by scraping the sides of the pit.
    Make a composite sample by mixing samples from all pits thoroughly after breaking all lumps.
    Carry out successive quartering along with
    thorough mixing each time to prepare a final sample weighing about 500 gm. Dry samples in shade and pack them in
    clean cloth bags.
    Label each sample to provide the following information to help the chemist to 
    schedule accurate fertilizer / amendment recommendations.
    Farmer’s name and address. Cropping history. Crop intended to be grown.
    Details of standing crop, if any. Date of last ploughing.
    Quantity of lime, Gypsum and fertilizers applied and date of last application.
    Whether green manuring is practiced, if so when.</p>

<p><em>Soil Analysis</em></p>
<p>Soil samples are analyzed for the following
five soil properties.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Soil pH, which indicates whether the
soil is acidic, alkaline or normal.</li>
    <li>Total soluble salts, which indicates
whether the soil is saline or normal.</li>
    <li>Organic carbon, as measure of available
nitrogen.</li>
    <li>Available Phosphorus.</li>
    <li>Available Potash.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever facilities exist samples are also
analyzed for micro nutrients, especially for Zinc,
Iron, Boran, Manganese and Copper.</p>

<p><em>Soil test result interpretation</em></p>
<p>Soil test report usually has three main parts
apart from the farmer and soil sample details.
The first part indicates the actual test 
values in respect of pH, EC, OC, N, P, K,
S and wherever facilities are available it also
includes Zn, Fe, B, Mn and Cu.
The rating of the soil as Low, Medium
and High is also indicated against each
component. The second and third parts contain
recommendations on application of macro,
secondary and micronutrients along with
organic manure, biofertilizers and soil
amendment required, if any.
Conventionally, when the soils are classified
as ‘Medium’ in respect of the nutrient status,
it is recommended to apply fertilizers as per
the recommendations for the particular crop.</p>

<p><em>Food - The supreme medicine:</em></p>
<p>Just like human beings, plants also need balanced nutrition for higher performance.
    Balanced nutrition gives the plants general health and vigor.
    Vigorous plants are less prone to insect and disease attack.
    Plant protection begins with plant nutrition.
    Hence, Plant nutrition and Plant protection should go hand in hand.
    Man's health is dependent on Plant's health.
    Plant's health is dependent on Soil's health.
    Let us conserve soil and its health.</p>

<p><em>Root, Leaf &amp; Chlorophyll:</em></p>
<p>All crops are primarily plants.
    Only Plants have the ability to produce food
    on their own and provide food to rest of us
    directly or indirectly.
    Root, leaf and chlorophyll play major role in food production.</p>
    
<p><em>ROOTS:</em></p>
<p>Roots are not just leg of the plant, but also
mouth of the plant. They are the supplier of raw material like
water and minerals to the leaf.
Hence, larger the root system (deeper &amp;
wider) – quicker the absorption and supply
of raw materials to the leaves.
Deeper the root system more the drought
resistance to the plants.
Healthier the root – higher the efficiency of
the root activity.
Anything that can impair the root growth
can also impair its function.
Physical factors like soil texture, temperature,
moisture and physical damage can affect
root growth.
Chemical factors like soil pH can impair the
mineral absorption of the minerals.
Biological factors like soil-borne insects, 
nematodes, pathogenic bacteria and fungi
can cause disease and hence impair the
root’s functions.
Hence, it is important to ensure that the
roots are healthy and functional.</p>

<p><em>LEAVES:</em></p>

<p>Leaf is the kitchen of the plant where food
is prepared.
More the number of leaves and larger their
size, more kitchen space to cook food faster.
Anything that affects the leaf development
will affect their efficiency.
Damages due to foliar diseases caused by
viruses, bacteria, fungi and insects drastically
reduce their efficacy.
Physical factors like very low or high
temperatures, lack of sufficient water and
nutrition can lead to poor leaf development.
So help the plant to have more and larger
leaves for better productivity</p>

<p><em>CHLOROPHYLL:</em></p>
<p>Chlorophyll is the cook in the kitchen.
Only this green pigment of the plant has
the ability to use solar energy required for
photosynthesis.
Larger the number of chlorophyll content
per unit area, greener the leaves.
Greener the leaf, faster the food production
per unit time.
Many nutrients like Nitrogen, Magnesium,
Iron and Zinc are very essential elements for
chlorophyll production.
Through balanced nutrition help the plant to
grow big and greener for higher yields.</p>

<p><strong><em>MANURES AND FERTILIZERS</em></strong></p>

<p>Fertilizer is any material of natural or synthetic origin added to the soil to supply
one or more plant nutrients. Fertilizers and Pesticides are the two majorsupplies for agriculture. 
Fertilizers and pesticides play the role of food and medicine for plants in conventional agriculture.
Fertilizers are the most widely used materials. Based on the production process, they are broadly 
categorized into Organic manures, Bio-fertilizers and Chemical Fertilizers.</p>

<p><strong>Organic Manures</strong></p>

<p>These are derived from animal, human and plant residues, which contain plant nutrients
in complex organic forms. Manures have lower nutrient content per
unit quantity, compared to fertilizers with high nutrient content. Manures have longer residual effect and
improve soil physical, chemical and biological properties.
Major sources of organic manures are:
<ul>
    <li>Cattle shed wastes - dung, urine and
slurry from biogas plants.</li>
    <li>Human habitation wastes - night soil,
human urine, urban waste, sewage,
sludge, etc.</li>
    <li>Poultry litter, droppings of sheep and
goat.</li>
    <li>Slaughter house wastes - bone meal,
meat meal, blood meal, horn and hoof
meal, fish wastes, etc.</li>
    <li>By-products of agro industries - oil
cakes, bagasse and press mud, fruit and
vegetable processing wastes, etc.</li>
    <li>Crop wastes - sugarcane trash, stubbles
and other related materials.</li>
    <li>Water hyacinth, weeds and tank silt. </li>
    <li>Green manure crops, etc.</li>
</ul>
Manures can be grouped into Bulk organic
manures and Concentrated organic
manures based on the concentration of
nutrients.</p>

<p><strong>Bulk organic manures</strong></p>

<p>Bulk organic manures contain low
concentrations of nutrients and are applied
in large quantities. Farmyard manure (FYM), compost and
green-manure are the most important and
widely used bulk organic manures. Use of bulk organic manures has several
advantages:
<ul>
    <li>They supply all plant nutrients including
micronutrients.</li>
    <li>They improve physical properties of soil
like structure, water holding capacity,
etc.</li>
    <li>They increase the availability of
nutrients.</li>
    <li>Organic manures also help in balancing
the soil pH.</li>
    <li>Organic matter improves biological
properties of the soil by supporting
survival and multiplication of beneficial
organisms such as nutrient mobilizing/
solubilizing bacteria, microorganisms
antagonistic to plant pathogens, etc. </li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>a. Farm yard manure (FYM):</strong></p>
<p>Farmyard manure is the decomposed mixture
of dung and urine of farm animals along with
litter and left over material from roughages
or fodder fed to the cattle. On an average well decomposed farmyard
manure contains 0.5% N, 0.2% P2O5 and0.5% K2O.</p>

<p><strong>Application:</strong></p>
<p>Generally FYM is applied @ 4 to 8 MT/acre. The entire amount of nutrients present in
farmyard manure is not available immediately. About 30% of Nitrogen, 60 to 70% of
Phosphorus and 70% of Potassium are available to the first crop. Well rotten manure can be applied just
before sowing. When the FYM is partially rotten it should be applied three to four weeks before sowing. The existing practice of leaving manure in
small heaps scattered in the field for a very long period leads to loss of nutrients. These losses can be reduced by spreading
the manure and incorporating by ploughing immediately after application.</p>

<p><strong>b. Sheep and Goat Manure:</strong></p>
<p>The droppings of sheep and goats contain
higher nutrients than farmyard manure and
compost. On an average, the manure contains 3% N,
1% P2O5 and 2% K2O. It is applied to the field in two ways: 
<ol>
    <li>The droppings collected from sheep
or goat sheds are stored pits for
decomposition and applied later to the
field. The nutrients present in the urine are
not used in this method.</li>
<li>The second method is sheep penning,
wherein sheep and goats are kept
overnight in the field. The urine and fecal matter added to the
soil is incorporated to a shallow depth
by working blade harrow or cultivator.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>c. Poultry Manure:</strong></p>
<p>Poultry manure contains higher Nitrogen
and Phosphorus compared to other bulk
organic manures. The average nutrient content is 3.0% N,
2.6% P2O5 and 1.4% K2O. The excreta of birds ferment very quickly.
If left exposed, 50% of its Nitrogen will be lost within 30 days. </p>
</p>

<p><strong>Concentrated organic manures</strong></p>
<p>Concentrated organic manures have higher
nutrient content than bulk organic manures. The important concentrated organic
manures are oilcakes, blood meal, fish manure, etc. 
These are also known as Organic Nitrogen Fertilizers. They are converted into readily usable
Ammoniacal Nitrogen and Nitrate Nitrogen through bacterial action.
Organic manures are therefore, relatively slow acting, but they supply available Nitrogen for a longer period.</p>

<p><strong>a. Oil Cakes:</strong></p>
<p>Solid portion left out after oil is extracted
from oilseeds is dried as cake and used as
manure. The oil cakes are of two types:
Edible oil cakes, which can be safely
fed to livestock; e.g., Groundnut cake,
Coconut cake etc. Non edible oil cakes e.g., Castor cake,
Neem cake, Mahua cake, etc. Both edible and non-edible oil cakes can be
used as manures. Nutrients present in oil cakes, after
mineralization, are available to crops 7 to 10
days after application. Oilcakes need to be well powdered before
application for even distribution and quicker
decomposition.</p>

<p><strong>b. Animal based Concentrated Organic
Manures:</strong></p>
<p>Blood meal when dried and powdered can
be used as manure. Meat dried and converted into meat meal is
a good source of Nitrogen.</p>

<p><strong>Role of Organic Matter in Soil Fertility</strong></p>

<p>Organic matter forms a very small but
important portion of soil. It is obtained from dead plant roots, crop
residues, various organic manures like farmyard manure, compost and green
manure, fungi, bacteria, worms and insects. Organic matter improves the physical
condition of the soil, particularly the
structure. Decaying organic matter acts as food for
bacteria, fungi and other organisms. Presence of organic matter helps dissolve
many soil minerals and renders them
available to plants. It plays an important role in the nutrient
supplying power of soil, as it has high cation exchange capacity (CEC). Increases the water holding capacity of the
soil, particularly in sandy soils.Improves aeration and infiltration in heavy
soils. Reduces loss of soil by water and wind
erosion. Regulates soil temperature. Serves as an important source of certain
plant of food elements (N, P, K, S, etc.). The buffering nature of the organic matter is
advantageous in management of pesticide,herbicide and heavy metals residues.
</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Organic Manures</strong></p>
<p>Organic manures are better source of
nutrient in balanced amounts than inorganic
fertilizers, where soil is deficient in both
macro and micronutrients. Organic based fertilizers supply
micronutrients, increase soil moisture
retention and reduce leaching of nutrients.
In addition to increasing yield and fertilizing
plants directly, organic manures improve
the biodiversity (soil life) and long-term
productivity of soil, and may prove a large
depository for excess carbon dioxide. Organic matter increases the abundance of
soil organisms by providing organic nutrients
and micronutrients for organisms such as
fungal mycorrhiza.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of Organic Manures</strong></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Hard to get.</li>
    <li>Not sterile.</li>
    <li>Generally contain weed seeds.</li>
    <li>Low in nutrient content.</li>
    <li>Generally cost significantly more than synthetic fertilizers.</li>
    <li>Just like chemical fertilizers organic manures also release nutrients into their surroundings,
which find their way into streams, rivers and estuaries.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><strong><em>BIO-FERTILIZERS</em></strong></p>
<p>Bio-fertilizers are microbial inoculants
capable of fixing and mobilizing important
nutritional elements in the soil through
biological processes. They include micro-organisms like bacteria,
fungi and algae capable of fixing atmospheric
Nitrogen or convert insoluble Phosphate and
Potash in the soil into forms available to the
plants. Soil microorganisms play an important
role in soil processes that determine plant
productivity. Some support plant growth indirectly,
by reducing growth restricting conditions
either through production of antagonistic
substances or by inducing resistance against
plant pathogens. The organic compounds, released by roots
and bacteria, play an important role in the
uptake of mineral nutrient. The hormones produced by the rhizosphere
bacteria have direct beneficial effects on
higher plants.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Bio-fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Bio-fertilizers have definite advantage over
chemical fertilizers. The bio-fertilizers effectively enrich the soil
and cost less than chemical fertilizers that
harm the environment and deplete nonrenewable energy sources. Bio-fertilizers provide certain growth
promoting substances like hormones,
vitamins, amino acids, etc., in addition to
respective nutrient. Bio-fertilizers supply the respective nutrient
continuously throughout the entire period
of crop growth in the field under favorable
conditions. Continuous use of chemical fertilizers
adversely affects the soil structure whereas
bio-fertilizers improve soil structure. Unlike chemical fertilizers that are toxic at
higher doses, bio-fertilizers have no toxic effects.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Bio-fertilizers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nitrogen fixing bio-fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Species of Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azospirillum,</li>
    <li>Azotobacter vinelandii,</li>
    <li>A. chroococcum,</li>
    <li>Acetobacter diazotrophicus, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phosphorus solubilizing bio-fertilizers
(PSB):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Pseudomonas striata,</li>
    <li>Bacillus polymixa,</li>
    <li>B. meagaterium,</li>
    <li>Species of Aspergillus, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potassium mobilizing bio-fertilizer:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Frateuria aurentia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sulphur solubilizing bio-fertilizer:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Thiobacillus thiooxidans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Zinc solubilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bacillus aryabhattai,</li>
    <li>Pseudomonas spp., etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Iron solubilizing bio-fertilizer:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Silicon solubilizing bio-fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bacillus spp.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vascular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM):
</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>These are obligate symbiotic fungi which
colonize the roots and help plants to capture
nutrients such as Phosphorus, Sulfur,
Nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil.</li>
<li>Myccorrhiza also imparts drought tolerance
to plants and resistance to soil borne fungal
pathogens.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bio-fertilizers are also available as consortia
that are blend of Nitrogen fixers (Azotobacter
and Azospirillium), Phosphate solubilizers and
Potash mobilizers.</p>

<p><strong>How do bio-fertilizers work?</strong></p>
<p>Bio-fertilizers fix atmospheric Nitrogen in
the soil and root nodules of legume crops
and make it available to the plants. They solubilize the insoluble forms of
Phosphates like Tricalcium, Iron and Aluminium Phosphates into available forms.
They scavenge Phosphate from soil layers. They produce hormones and metabolites,
which promote root growth. They decompose organic matter and help in
mineralization. When applied to seed or soil, bio-fertilizers
increase the availability of nutrients and improve the yield by 10 to 25% without
adversely affecting the soil and environment.
</p>

<p><strong><em>CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS (Synthetic Fertilizers</em></strong></p>
<p>
Chemical fertilizers play an important role in
increasing crop production. The main macronutrients present in
inorganic fertilizers are Nitrogen,
Phosphorus, and Potassium which influence
vegetative and reproductive phases of plant
growth. Fertilizers are available in both solid and
liquid forms. Solid fertilizers are available as Powders,
Crystals, Prills, Granules, Supergranules
and Briquettes. Liquid fertilizers are applied directly or with
irrigation water.
</p>

<p><strong>Straight Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>These supply only one primary plant
nutrient, namely Nitrogen or Phosphorus or
Potassium. e.g. Urea, Ammonium Sulphate,
Potassium Chloride and Potassium Sulphate.</p>

<p><strong>Complex fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>These are available generally in granular
form, contain two or three primary
plant nutrients of which two primary
nutrients are in chemical combination. e.g.
DiAmmonium Phosphate, NitroPhosphates
and Ammonium Phosphate.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>These are mix of straight fertilizers that
contain two or three primary plant nutrients.</p>

<p><strong>1. Nitrogenous fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Nitrogenous fertilizers are most widely
used among fertilizers since deficiency of
Nitrogen in the soil is the foremost and
crops respond to Nitrogen better than to
other nutrient. They account for over 80% of fertilizers
used, particularly Urea. It is extremely efficient in increasing the
productivity of crops and the possibilities of
its economic production are unlimited. </p>

<p><strong>1.1. Ammoniacal fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p> Ammoniacal fertilizers contain Nitrogen in the form of Ammonium or
Ammonia. These are readily soluble in water and therefore readily available
 to crops. Except rice, all crops absorb Nitrogen
in Nitrate form. These fertilizers are resistant to
leaching loss, as the Ammonium ions get readily adsorbed on the colloidal
complex of the soil. </p>

<p><strong>a) Ammonium Sulphate [(NH4)2SO4]</strong></p>
<p>A white salt completely soluble in water,
which is advantageously used in paddy and jute cultivation. Contains about 20% Nitrogen and
24.0% Sulphur. Can be applied before or at the time of sowing or as top-dressing in growing
crop. Once most widely used but presently less commonly used. It is especially valuable where both N and Sulfur (S)
are required. It's high solubility provides versatility for
a number of agricultural applications. Although there are other fertilizers
that contain higher percentages of N, it provides an excellent source
of S, which has numerous essential functions in plants, including protein
synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses:</strong></p>
<p>	 Ammonium Sulphate is used primarily where
there is a need for supplementing N and S. Because the N fraction is present in the
Ammonium form, it is frequently used in flooded soils for rice production, where
Nitrate-based fertilizers are a poor choice because of leaching losses. 
A solution containing dissolved Ammonium Sulphate is often added to post-emergence
herbicide sprays to improve their efficacy, particularly when the water contains
significant concentrations of Calcium, Magnesium or Sodium.High-purity grade of Ammonium Sulphate is
often used for this purpose to avoid plugging spray nozzles. 
</p>
<p><strong>b) Ammonium Chloride (NH4Cl):</strong></p>
<p>It is a white salt containing 26.0%
Nitrogen and 66% Chlorine. Ammoniacal Nitrogen is not lost by
leaching, since NH4  is fixed by soil clay
and humus complex. Ammonium Chloride fertilizer
application is recommended for saline
and alkaline soils. Chlorine present in Ammonium
Chloride gives resistance to some
pests and diseases. Ammonium Chloride is less
hygroscopic than other fertilizers and
thus has a fairly long shelf life. The chloride radical in Ammonium
Chloride frees Phosphorous, Potash, Magnesium, Silica, Iron, etc., from the
soil. It can be applied both as basal and top
dressing. It is usually not recommended for crops
like Tomato, Potato, Grapes, Tobacco, etc., which may be injured by Chlorine.</p>

<p><strong>c) Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3):</strong></p>
<p>It is a colorless and pungent gas
containing 82.0% Nitrogen. It is inexpensive and can be applied
directly to soil by injection using blade
type applicator having tubes. It becomes liquid (Anhydrous
Ammonia) under suitable conditions of
temperature and pressure.</p>

<p><strong>1.2. Nitrate Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>They contain the Nitrogen in the form
of NO3. These ions are easily lost by leaching
because of the greater mobility of Nitrate
ions in the soil. Continuous use of these fertilizers
may reduce the soil acidity as these
Nitrogenous fertilizers are basic in their
residual effect.</p>

<p><strong>a) Sodium Nitrate (Chile Salt Peter or Chilean Nitrate) [NaNO3]:</strong></p>
<p>Sodium Nitrate is a white salt containing about 15.6% Nitrogen. It is soluble in water and available for the
plants, without any chemical change in the soil. It is easily lost by leaching and
denitrification. When large quantities of Sodium Nitrate
are added year after year, the Nitrate ions are absorbed by crops and Sodium
ions accumulate and affect the structure of the soil. Sodium Nitrate is particularly useful in acidic soils.</p>

<p><strong>b) Calcium Nitrate [Ca(NO3)2]:</strong></p>
<p>It is a white crystalline hygroscopic solid containing 15.5% Nitrogen and 19.5% Calcium. Calcium is useful for maintaining
desirable soil pH. It's high solubility makes it an immediately available source of Nitrate and
Calcium directly to soil through irrigation water, or as foliar applications.
Nitrate moves freely with soil moisture and is immediately taken up by plant
roots. Unlike many other common N fertilizers, Ca(NO3)2 does not acidify soils.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses:</strong></p>
<p>Calcium Nitrate is popular in agronomic situations where a readily soluble source of
Nitrate or Calcium is needed. Broadcast application of Ca(NO3)2 
is desirable because the risk of Ammonia volatilization is
eliminated with its use. Ca(NO3)2 is also used to provide supplemental
Ca for plant nutrition. Since Ca is not mobile in the plant it is
important to apply Ca at critical growth stages. Solutions of Ca(NO3)2 
are commonly added to irrigation water, foliar and fruit sprays to overcome such shortcomings that affect
yield and/or quality (blossom end rots in vegetables), or to meet peak Ca demands
during critical growth periods. Ca(NO3)2 is Chloride-free and can have an ameliorating effect under saline growing
conditions, combating the negative effects of Na and Cl.
Calcium is an important nutrition that gives rigidity to cell wall and offers resistance to
many abiotic and biotic stresses. Ca(NO3)2 is widely used in intensive cropping
systems that have a high focus on crop quality.</p>

<p><strong>c) Potassium Nitrate (Salt Peter) [KNO3]:</strong></p>
<p>Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) is a soluble source of two major essential plant nutrients. 
    The purified salt contains 13.0% Nitrogen and 45% K2O or 36.4% Potassium. N is immediately available for plant uptake as Nitrate, requiring no additional
microbial action and transformation in the soil. The Nitrogen of the Potassium Nitrate has the same properties and value as
that of the Sodium Nitrate. Potassium Nitrate is commonly sold as water-soluble, crystalline material primarily intended for application with water or
in a prilled form for soil application.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>Growers of high value vegetable and orchard
crops prefer to use a Nitrate-based source
of nutrition in an effort to boost yield and
quality. It is commonly used for high-value crops that
benefit from Nitrate (NO3-) nutrition and a
source of Potassium (K+) free of Chloride (Cl-
). Many crops have high K demands and can
remove as much or more K than N at harvest.KNO3 is applied to the soil before the growing season or as a supplement during
the growing season. Foliar application of K during fruit
development can be advantageous, since it often coincides with high K demand,
declining root activity and nutrient uptake. It is also commonly used for greenhouse
plant production and hydroponic culture. </p>

<p><strong>1.3. Ammoniacal and Nitrate Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>These fertilizers contain Nitrogen in both Ammonium and Nitrate forms. 
    Nitrates are available for rapid utilization by 
    crops and the Ammonical form for gradual utilization.</p>

<p><strong>a) Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3):</strong></p>
<p>Ammonium Nitrate was the first solid Nitrogen (N) fertilizer produced in large
scale. It is white, water soluble and hygroscopic crystalline salt containing 35% Nitrogen, one half in Nitrate and the other half in
Ammonium form. The Nitrate form is mobile in the soil water and is immediately available for
plant uptake. The Ammonium fraction is taken up if
roots grow nearby or after it is converted to Nitrate by soil microorganisms during
nitrification. In the Ammonium form, it cannot be
easily leached from the soil. Since plant roots do not directly absorb the urea form of N to a large extent,
Ammonium Nitrate is an efficient and immediate source of plant nutrition. This fertilizer is quick-acting, but highly
hygroscopic and not fit for storage. It has an acidulating effect on the soil. It is dangerous in pure form because of explosion hazard.
</p>

<p><strong>b) Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) (5Ca(NO3)2 NH4NO3.10H2O:</strong></p>
<p>Calcium Ammonium Nitrate is a fine free-flowing, light brown or grey granular
fertilizer, containing 25% Nitrogen and 18.5% Calcium. It is almost neutral and can be safely
applied even to acid soils. Half of its total Nitrogen is in the Ammoniacal form and half is in Nitrate form.</p>

<p><strong>c) Ammonium Sulphate Nitrate [(NH4)2SO4 NH4NO3]:</strong></p>
<p>It contains 26% Nitrogen, three fourths of which is in the Ammoniacal form and the
rest (6.5%) as Nitrate. In addition to Nitrogen it contains 12.1%
Sulphur.It is available in a white crystalline form or
as dirty-white granules. It is readily soluble in water and quickacting. It's keeping quality is good and it is useful
for all crops. It's acid effect on the soils is only one-half of that of Ammonium Sulphate.
It can be applied before sowing, at sowing time or as top-dressing.</p>

<p><strong>1.4. Amide Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>Amide fertilizers are readily soluble in water and easily decomposable in the soil. 
    The amide form of Nitrogen is easily changed to Ammoniacal and then to Nitrate form in the soil.</p>

<p><strong>a) Urea [CO(NH2)2]:</strong></p>
<p>It is the most widely used solid N fertilizer in the world. It is a white crystalline substance readily
soluble in water. It is the most concentrated solid Nitrogenous fertilizer, containing 46% Nitrogen.
 The high N content of urea makes it efficient to transport. 
 The Nitrogen in urea is readily fixed in the soil in Ammoniacal form and is not lost in 
 drainage. It may be applied at sowing or as topdressing. It absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and has to be kept in moisture proof 
 containers. Urea is also commonly found in naturesince it is expelled in the urine of animals.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>It is mostly mixed with soil or applied on the
soil surface. It may be dissolved in water and applied to
soil as a fluid, along with irrigation water, or
sprayed onto plant foliage. Urea in foliar sprays is quickly absorbed by
plant leaves. When urea contacts soil or plants, a naturally
occurring enzyme (urease) begins to quickly
convert urea back to NH3 in a process called
hydrolysis. During this process, the N in urea is
susceptible to undesirable gaseous losses as
NH3. Plants can utilize small amounts of urea
directly as a source of N, but they more commonly use 
the Ammonium and Nitrate that are produced after urea is transformed
by urease and soil microorganisms. In case of flooded fields or calcareous soils,
slow release Nitrogenous fertilizers like Sulphur coated urea, urea super granules,
neem coated or neem blended urea are to be used, so that loss of Nitrogen can be
minimized. Urea has good storage properties and causes
minimal corrosion of application equipment. Avoid urea when the fertilizer will remain
on the soil surface for prolonged periods of time.</p>

<p><strong>b ) Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) (CH8N4O4)</strong></p>
<p>Among fluid N fertilizers, a solution of urea [CO(NH2)2] and ammonium nitrate
[NH4NO3] containing between 28 and 32% N is the most popular.
While 25% of total N in the form of NO3-is immediately available for plant uptake,
25% in NH4+ form is rapidly oxidized by soil bacteria to form NO3-. The remaining urea portion (50% of the
total N) is hydrolyzed by soil enzymes to form NH4+, which is subsequently transformed to NO3- in most soil 
conditions. However, additional management may be required to avoid volatile losses. 
UAN is compatible with many other nutrients and agricultural chemicals,
and is frequently mixed with solutions containing P, K, and other essential plant
nutrients. UAN solutions are commonly injected into
soil beneath the surface, sprayed onto the soil surface, added to irrigation water, or
sprayed onto plant leaves as a source of foliar nutrition. </p>

<p><strong>c) Calcium Cyanamide (CaCN2):</strong></p>
<p>Calcium cyanamide or nitrolime contains 20.6% Nitrogen. It is a greyish white powdery material
that decomposes in moist soil giving rise to Ammonia.</p>

<p><strong>Urease inhibitors</strong></p>
<p>All forms of Urea have the disadvantage of undergoing considerable losses as
Ammonia gas, if not incorporated into soil soon after application.
The loss of Ammonia, termed volatilization, can be as high as 50%.
Factors like surface application, inadequate irrigation following
application, high temperatures, high soil pH and low cation exchange capacity of
soil further increase loss of Ammonia. Urease inhibitors are compounds that
when added to Urea slow the rate of Ammonia production, thereby reduce
Ammonia loss to the atmosphere. These compounds that inhibit urease are
chemically stable and are mixed with or coated onto urea-containing fertilizers.
e.g. N-(n-Butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBTPT), Phosphoric triamide (NBPTO),
Phenylphosphorodiamidate (PPD) and hydroquinone.</p>

<p><strong>Nitrification inhibitors</strong></p>
<p>These are compounds that reduce the rate at which Ammonium is converted to
nitrate, thus help reduce N losses through denitrification and leaching. 
They help in preserving N as Ammonium and delay nitrate production by
depressing the activity of Nitrosomonas bacteria. The most commonly used
nitrification inhibitors are 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine (Nitrapyrin),
dicycandiamide (DCD) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). 
These can be injected directly into the soil with anhydrous Ammonia (Nitrapyrin) or
coated onto solid N fertilizers or mixed with manures. Their inhibitory effect will last from 25
to over 70 days. In general, nitrification inhibitors are more effective in sandy soils, or soil low
in organic matter and exposed to low temperatures.</p>

<p><strong>Coated fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Coating fertilizers to ensure sustained release of nutrients is an effective but
less expensive method when compared to the use of nitrification inhibitors. A variety of coatings have been applied
to fertilizer particles to control their solubility in soil and rate of nutrient
release offering multiple environmental, economic, and yield benefits. Elemental sulphur (S) was the first widely
used fertilizer coating, where molten S was sprayed over urea granules. 
Later it was covered with thin layer of organic polymer. 
Presently, various resin-based polymers are used to coat fertilizer granules. 
Coatings are most commonly applied to granular or prilled nitrogen (N) fertilizer,
but multi-nutrient fertilizers receive the coatings as well. Since urea contains the highest N of
common soluble fertilizers, it is the base material for most coated fertilizers. It has been established that Neem oil
serves as an effective inhibitor if coated on Urea, ensuring gradual release of
urea and reduced loss due to leaching. Depending on the composition and
thickness of the coating the duration of nutrient release can vary from several
weeks to many months. Although coated fertilizers cost more
than the uncoated materials, they significantly decrease loss of nutrients
through leaching and gaseous losses, mitigate fertilizer burn, save on cost of
fertilizer application by eliminating the need for multiple fertilizer applications
and ensure uniform plant nutrition, better growth and improved plant performance.</p>

<p><strong>2. Phosphatic fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Phosphatic fertilizers are chemical substances that contain the nutrient Phosphorus in absorbable form (Phosphate anions) or that
yield after conversion in the soil. They should be basal placed in the root zone,
because their poor mobility restricts them to the place of application.</p>

<p><strong>a) Single Super Phosphate [Ca(H2PO4)2]</strong></p>
<p>Single Super Phosphate (SSP) was the first commercial mineral fertilizer that led
to the development of the modern plant nutrient industry. This material was once the most
commonly used fertilizer, but other Phosphorus (P) fertilizers have largely
replaced SSP because of its relatively low P content. It contains 16% P2O5 in available form(Phosphorus- 7 to 9%), 18 to 21% Calcium
and 11 to 12% Sulphur and essential micronutrients in small proportions. In agronomic studies where SSP is
demonstrated to be superior to other P fertilizers, it is usually due to the S and
Ca that it contains. It is a grey ash like powder with good keeping or storage qualities. SSP helps to treat Sulphur deficiency
in soils (40% of Indian soils are Sulphur deficient).</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses:</strong></p>
<p>SSP is an excellent source of three plant nutrients. The presence of both P and Sulphur (S) in
SSP can be an agronomic advantage where both of these nutrients are deficient. 
Continuous application of SSP reclaims Alkali soils. 
It improves root formation and ensures quality product output. 
When locally available, SSP has found widespread use for fertilizing pastures where both P and S are needed. 
Phosphatic fertilizers hardly move in the soil and hence they are to be placed in the root zone. </p>

<p><strong>b) Triple Super Phosphate (TSP): </strong></p>
<p>The concentrated super Phosphate is called as Triple Super Phosphate and it
contains 46% P2O5. Technically, it is Calcium dihydrogen
Phosphate or Monocalcium Phosphate, [Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O]. This fertilizer is suitable for all crops
across all soils. In acid soils, it should be used in
conjunction with organic manure. It can be applied before or at sowing or
transplanting. It is an excellent source of P, but its use has declined as other P fertilizers have
become more popular. </p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>	 It has the highest P content for a dry fertilizer that does not contain N. 
    Over 90% of the total P in TSP is water soluble, so it becomes rapidly available for 
    plant uptake. As soil moisture dissolves the granule, the concentrated soil solution becomes acidic. 
    TSP also contains 15% Calcium, providing an additional plant nutrient. 
    A major use of TSP is in situations where several solid fertilizers are blended together 
    for broadcasting on the soil surface or for application in a concentrated band beneath 
    the surface. It is also desirable for fertilization of leguminous crops, such as Alfalfa or Beans,
    where no additional N fertilization is needed to supplement biological N fixation. </p>

<p><strong>c) Rock Phosphate (RP): </strong></p>
<p>Rock Phosphate is a naturally occurring mineral, inexpensive and best suited for
acidic soils. Unlike water-soluble P fertilizers that quickly dissolve, RP dissolves slowly to
gradually release nutrients, but the rate of dissolution may be too slow to support
healthy plant growth in some soils. It is necessary to apply RP well in advance
of the plant demand owing to its slow dissolution. Low Calcium and high organic matter in
the soil tend to speed RP dissolution. It is usually not recommended when the
soil pH exceeds 5.5. It should be broadcasted and incorporated with tillage to speed up reaction with the
soil.RP also contains 5% Calcium carbonate. Because of its natural occurrence, it
is recommended even in organic crop cultivation.</p>

<p><strong>d) Phosphoric acid:</strong></p>
<p>Application of Phosphorus to irrigation water may cause precipitation of
Phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid and Mono Ammonium
Phosphate are more suitable for fertigation. Phosphoric acid is inexpensive, provides
highest amount of Phosphorus (52%) and cleans up the drip system. </p>

<p><strong>e) Mono-Amonium Phosphate (MAP)[(NH4)(H2PO4)] and (f) Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) [(NH4)2HPO4]</strong></p>
<p>These are two widely used phosphate fertilizers. The characteristics and agricultural use of
these important sources of phosphorous are discussed under Complex fertilizers.</p>

<p><strong>3. Potassic fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Potassic fertilizers are chemical substances containing Potassium in absorbed form (K+). 
    There are two Potassium fertilizers viz., Muriate of potash (KCl) and Sulphate of 
    potash (K2SO4). They are water soluble and so are readily available to plants. 
    The potassic fertilizers should be basal placed in the root zone, because their 
    poor mobility restricts them to the place of application.</p>

<p><strong>a) Potassium Chloride (KCl) or Muriate of Potash (MOP):</strong></p>
<p>Potassium Chloride is a white or red, crystal containing 60.0% K2O. It is completely soluble in water and 
    therefore readily available to the crops. The K+ will be retained on the negatively charged cation exchange sites of clay 
    and organic matter. The Cl- portion will readily move with the water. It is not lost from the soil, as it is adsorbed 
    on the colloidal surfaces. The Chlorine content is about 47.0%.
</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>Potassium Chloride is the most widely used K fertilizer due to its relatively low cost and
because it includes more K (50 to 52%) than most other sources (60 to 63% K2O and 45 to 47% Cl). 
Its Chlorine content (47%) is objectionable to some crops like tobacco, potato, etc., where
quality is the consideration. It can be applied at sowing or before or after sowing. Potassium Chloride is often spread onto the soil surface prior to tillage and planting. 
It may also be applied in a concentrated band near the seed. Since dissolving fertilizer will increase the 
soluble salt concentration, KCl is placed to the side of the seed to avoid damaging the
germinating plant. Pure grade of KCl can be dissolved for fluid fertilizers or applied through irrigation systems. </p>

<p><strong>b) Potassium Sulphate (K2SO4):</strong></p>
<p>This “potash” is commonly referred to as Sulphate of Potash or SOP.
     It is a white salt and contains 50% K2O and 17 to 18% Sulphur. It is soluble in water and therefore readily 
     available to the crop. It does not produce any acidity or alkalinity in the soil. It is preferred for 
     fertilization of crops like Tobacco, Potato etc., where quality is of prime importance. 
     It is expensive because it is made by treating Potassium Chloride with Magnesium Sulphate. </p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>SOP supplies a valuable source of S, required for protein synthesis and enzyme function.
    In crops where addition of Cl is to be avoided, K2SO4 makes a very suitable K source. 
    Potassium Sulphate is only one-third as soluble as KCl, so it is not as commonly 
    added through irrigation water unless there is a need for additional S. 
    Fine particles (&lt0.015 mm) are used for making solutions for irrigation or foliar sprays. 
    Foliar spray of K2SO4 is a convenient way to apply additional K and S to plants, 
    supplementing the nutrients taken up from the soil. Leaf damage can occur if the concentration is too high.</p>

<p><strong>4. Complex fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>Complex or Compound fertilizers have two
or more primary essential plant nutrients
combined into each particle.
 This allows each granule to deliver a mixture
of nutrients as it dissolves in the soil and
avoids segregation of nutrient sources during
transport or application.
 These offer advantages like convenience of
application in the field and economic savings
in meeting the crop nutritional needs.
 The transportation and application cost is
relatively less when compared to straight
fertilizers.
 When micronutrients are included in
compound fertilizers, uniform distribution
throughout the root zone can be achieved.
 Although several grades of complex
fertilizers are available, it could be required
to supplement them with straight fertilizers,
when the proportion of nutrients does not
meet the requirements of a particular crop.
 These fertilizers are recommended to be
applied before planting or early in the growth
period and later nitrogenous fertilizers are to
be applied as required.
 Application of complex fertilizers works out
more expensive as compared to straight
fertilizers.
 Since they may not supply the major nutrients
in a crop specific ratio, Hence, it is always
better to use straight fertilizers.</p>

<p><strong>a) Nitrophosphate</strong></p>
<p>These are combinations of Ammonium
Phosphate, Monoammonium phosphate
and Diammonium phosphate with or
without potassium salt.
 Nitrophosphates contain Nitrogen and
Phosphorus in several proportions.
 Nitrophosphate fertilizers vary depending
on the combinations of nutrients used to
make the final granule. Popular grades are:
<ul>
    <li>N & P: ranging from 20-20-0 to 25-25-0, 28-14-0, 20-30-0.</li>
    <li>N-P-K: ranging from 15-15-15 to 17-17-17, 21-7-14, 10-20-20, 15-20-15, 12-24-12, 10-26-26.</li>
</ul>
 They are sold in granular form to be
applied by spreading on the soil surface,
mixed within the root zone, or applied
as a concentrated band beneath the soil
surface prior to planting.
 Nitrophosphate fertilizers attract
moisture and need to be protected from moisture. </p>

<p><strong>b) Ammonium Phosphate:</strong></p>
<p> The widely used ammonium phosphate
fertilizers are: </p>
<p>i. Mono-Ammonium Phosphate (MAP)[(NH4)(H2PO4)]:</p>
<p>MAP contains 12% Nitrogen and 61% P2O5. It is a widely used source of N and P.
 It is water soluble and dissolves rapidly in soil if adequate moisture is present.
 The pH of the solution surrounding the granule is moder¬ately acidic, making 
 MAP an especially desirable fertilizer in neutral and high pH soils.
 It should be applied in concentrated bands beneath the soil surface close to 
 growing roots. It is also commonly applied by spreading across the field and mixing into the
 surface soil with tillage. </p>

 <p><strong>ii. Di-Ammonium Phosphate [DAP][(NH4)2HPO4]:</strong></p>
 <p>DAP is the world’s most widely used Phosphorus (P) fertilizer. 
     The standard grade of DAP is 18-46-0, containing 18% N, 46% P2O5.
     The black colour and uniform sized granules contain micro nutrients such as Iron and important plant nutrients
     such as Sulphur, Calcium, Magnesium, Nitrogen and Phosphate. It has excellent handling and storage properties.
     It is recommended for basal application of fertilizers due to its slow releasing nature. </p>

<p>Note: When applying MAP as a foliar spray or through irrigation water, do not mix with
Calcium or Magnesium fertilizers.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>DAP is an excellent source of Phosphorus
(P) and Nitrogen (N) for plant nutrition.
 It is highly soluble and thus dissolves quickly
in soil to release plant-available Phosphate
and Ammonium.
 A notable property of DAP is the alkaline pH
that develops around the dissolving granule.
 As ammonium is released from dissolving
DAP granules, volatile Ammonia can be
harmful to seedlings and plant roots in
immediate proximity.
 This potential damage is more common when
the soil pH is greater than 7, a condition that
commonly exists around the dissolving DAP
granule.
 To prevent the possibility of seedling damage,
care should be taken to avoid placing high
concentrations of DAP near germinating
seeds.
 The Ammonium present in DAP is an
excellent N source and is gradually converted
to nitrate by soil bacteria, resulting in a
subsequent drop in pH.
 Therefore, the rise in soil pH surrounding
DAP granules is a temporary effect.
 This initial rise in soil pH neighboring DAP
can influence the micro-site reactions of Phosphate and soil organic matter.  </p>

<p><strong>iii. Ammonium Phosphate: </strong></p>
<p>Contains 16% N and 20% P2O5.</p>
<p><strong>iv. Urea Ammonium Phosphate (UAP): </strong></p>
<p>UAP is available in grades like 28-28-0, 24-24-0 and 20-20-0.</p>
<p><strong>v. Polyphosphate: </strong></p>
<p>a. Is an excellent liquid fertilizer that is widely used in agriculture.</p>
<p>b. The most common ammonium polyphosphate fertilizers have N-P2O5-K2O composition of 10-34-0 or 11-37-0.</p>
<p><strong>vi. Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate[20:20:0:13]: </strong></p>
<p>a. This special product contains 20% N,20% P2O5, and 13% S.</p>
<p>b. It is highly soluble in water and has greater mobility in soil.</p>
<p>c. It can be applied both as initial application and top dressing for supply of N, P2O5, and Sulphur nutrients.</p>
<p><strong>c) N.P.K. Complex fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>These are complex fertilizers containing N, P2O5 and K2O in various proportions.</p>

<p><strong><em>SECONDARY MAJOR NUTRIENT FERTILIZERS</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Magnesium fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>These are chemical substances containing Magnesium in the form of Magnesium cations (Mg2+).</p>
<p><strong>a) Magnesium Sulphate monohydrate (MgSO4.H2O):</strong></p>
<p>Magnesium Sulphate is a naturally
occurring mineral that contains 9.6% Mg
and 13% S. It is mined from geologic marine deposits
and provides a soluble source of both Mg
and S for plant nutrition. </p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses:</strong></p>
<p>Magnesium Sulphate provides a highly concentrated form of two essential plant
nutrients—Mg and S. Since Magnesium Sulphate applications have
no major effect on soil pH, it can be used in
all kinds of soils, irrespective of soil pH.
 It is commonly used prior to or during the
growing season to meet the nutrient requirement of crops.
 Due to its high solubility it can be used to
supply both Mg and S during peak periods
of crop demand.
 Since Magnesium Sulphate is an earth mineral
mined from naturally occurring deposits, it is
permitted as an organic nutrient source by
some organic certifying agencies.
 Magnesium Sulphate is totally soluble
and suitable for both fertigation and foliar
application. </p>

<p><strong> 2. Calcium fertilizers </strong></p>
<p>These are chemical substances containing the Calcium as absorbable Calcium cations (Ca2+).
 The raw material of Calcium fertilizers is lime found in nature.</p>

<p><strong>a. Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3 ):</strong></p>
<p>Calcium carbonate, the chief component of limestone, is a widely used amendment to
      neutralize soil acidity and to supply Calcium (Ca) for plant nutrition. </p>

<p>The term “lime” can refer to several products, but for agricultural use it generally refers to ground limestone.</p>
<p>Limestone/Calcite – Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) - mostly insoluble in water, but solubility increases in acid conditions and it contains a maximum of 40% Ca.</p>
<p>Dolomite – Calcium Magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO3)2] - mostly insoluble in water, but solubility increases in acid conditions and it contains between 2 to 13% Mg. </p>
<p>Hydrated/Slaked lime – Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] - relatively insoluble in water; forms a solution of pH >12.</p>
<p>Burned lime/Quick lime – Calcium oxide (CaO) - reacts with water to form hydrated lime.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>It is primarily used to raise the pH of acid soils
and reduce the concentration of Aluminium (Al) in soil solution. Poor crop growth in acid soils is largely
due to soluble Al, which is toxic to the root system of many plants. Lime will reduce soluble Al either by the
reaction CaCO3 + H2O I Ca2+ + 2OH- + CO2 or Al3 + [soluble] + 3OH- I Al(OH)3 [insoluble].
Addition of Calcium Carbonate also supplies valuable Ca (and possibly Mg) for plant nutrition.
Some secondary benefits of neutralizing soil acidity with agricultural lime include:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Increased Phosphorus (P) availability. </li>
    <li>Improved Nitrogen (N) fixation by legumes.</li>
    <li>Enhanced N mineralization and nitrification.</li>
    <li>Better water use, nutrient recovery, and plant performance with a healthier root system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Calcium Nitrate [Ca (NO3)2]</strong></p>
<p>Calcium Nitrate is a highly soluble source of Nitrate and Calcium, which can be added directly to soil, through irrigation
water, or with foliar applications. Chemical formula: </p>
<p>Solid Ca (NO3)2•NH4NO3•10 H2O15.5% N, 18 to 22% Ca, &lt1.5% NH4</p>
<p>Liquid Ca(NO3)2•4H2O8 to 9% N, 11 to 12% Ca, &lt1% NH4</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural uses: </strong></p>
<p>Calcium Nitrate is popular in agronomic
situations where a readily soluble source of
Nitrate or Calcium is needed.
 Nitrate moves freely with soil moisture and
can be immediately taken up by plant roots.
 Unlike many other common N fertilizers,
Ca(NO3)2 application does not acidify soils
since there is no acidity producing nitrification
of Ammonium occurring. Broadcast application of Ca(NO3)2 
is desirable in some circumstances because the risk of 
Ammonia volatilization is eliminated. Ca(NO3)2 is also used to provide supplemental
Ca to the crop. Solutions of Ca(NO3)2 are commonly added
to irrigation water and to foliar and fruit
sprays to overcome Ca deficiency that can
affect yield and/or quality (Apple bitter pit),
or to meet peak Ca demands during critical
growth periods. Part of the popularity of Ca(NO3)2 also arises
from its Chloride-free nature and it can have
an ameliorating effect under saline growing
conditions, combating the negative effects of
Na and Cl-. Calcium is an important nutrition that gives
rigidity to cell wall and offers resistance to
many abiotic and biotic stresses. Ca(NO3)2 is widely used in intensive cropping
systems that have a high focus on crop quality.</p>

<p><strong>c) Calcium Chloride (CaCl2.6H2O):</strong></p>
<p> It contains at least 15% Calcium. It is highly water soluble and can,
therefore, be dissolved for application as
a foliar nutrient. Effective in management of bitter pit
disease in apple, spongy tissues in mango
and fruit cracking in lemon. It increases the keeping quality of fruits.</p>

<p>Note: To avoid precipitating insoluble fertilizer salts, Ca(NO3)2 should not be mixed with soluble
Phosphate or Sulphate fertilizers in nutrient solutions or for fertigation. </p>

<p><strong> 3. Sulphate fertilizers</strong></p>
<p>	 These are chemical substances containing
the nutrient Sulphur in the form of absorbable
Sulphate anions (SO4)2-. The Sulphur requirements of plants are about
two third of their Phosphorus requirements.
 Substantial Sulphur supplies occur as minor
constituents of various N, P and K fertilizers.
 Fertilization with Sulphur becomes necessary
with increasing removal from the soil with
rising agricultural production especially in
plants with high Sulphur requirements, like
Mustard.
 Formulations containing 90% elemental
sulphur along with swelling agent like
Bentonite clay are available to ensure uniform
soil application.</p>

<p><strong>Thiosulphate: </strong></p>
<p>Thiosulfate (S2O32-) fertilizers are clear liquids
that provide a source of Sulphur.
 They also contain other nutrients including
Nitrogen, Potassium, Calcium or Magnesium.
 Thiosulfate quickly reacts to form
tetrathionate, which is subsequently
converted to sulphate, within 1-2 weeks and
become available for plant uptake.
 Thiosulphates may be applied through
surface irrigation, sprinklers, and drip
irrigation.
 Many of them are used in foliar sprays to
provide a rapid source of plant nutrition (not
recommended with ATS).
 Commonly available thiosulphates include
- Ammonium thiosulphate [(NH4)2S2O3;N 12%: S 26%], Potassium thiosulphate 
[K2S2O3; K2O 25%: S 17%], Calcium thiosulphate [CaS2O3; Ca 6%: S 10%] and Magnesium thiosulphate [MgS2O3; Mg 4%:S 10%].</p>

<p><strong>MICRONUTRIENT FERTILIZERS</strong></p>
<p>The importance of fertilization of crops with
micro-nutrients is increasing mainly because
of greater removal from the soil, intensive
liming of soil, intensive drainage of soil,
higher use of Nitrogenous, phosphatic and
potassic fertilizers, etc. There are seven essential micronutrients
required by plants - Iron, Manganese, Zinc,
Copper, Chlorine, Boron and Molybdenum.</p>

<p><strong>a) Iron fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>These are generally water soluble substances, predominantly sprayed on
crops as foliar nutrients. Plants absorb Iron in the form of Fe2+. Commonly used Iron fertilizers are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ferrous Sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O)</li>
    <li>It contains 20% Fe and 19% Sulphur.</li>
    <li>Iron chelates like Fe-EDTA, Fe-DTPA and Fe-EDDHSA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Manganese fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Manganous Sulphate (MnSO4.7H2O)</li>
    <li>Water soluble and contains 30% Mn and 17% Sulphur.</li>
    <li>Mn Chelates (Mn - EDTA)- contain 13% Mn.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c) Zinc fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p><em>Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4.7H2O></em>)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Water soluble whitish salt containing 23% Zn. Its acidic action causes corrosion damage to plants. </li>
    <li>Contains 15% Sulphur, which is also an essential element.</li>
    <li>It can be applied as basal dose by broadcast mixed with required sand and can also be applied by top dressing or placement.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Zinc-oxide (ZnO)</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Slightly soluble in water and contains 70% Zn.</li>
    <li>It is used as slow acting foliar nutrient.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Chelated Zinc (Zn - EDTA)</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Zn in chelated form, not only enables optimum utilization of Zinc, but also ensures complete availability of Zinc to the plant without fixation in the soil.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>d) Copper fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Copper Sulphate (CuSO4.5H2O) – contains 25% Cu. </li>
    <li>Copper Sulphate (CuSO4.H2O) –contains 36% Cu.</li>
    <li>It also contains 13% Sulphur.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>e) Boron fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Borax (Na2B4O.10H2O) – Water soluble and contains 10.5% B. </li>
    <li>Can be used for both soil or foliar application.</li>
    <li>Boric acid (H3BO3) - Contains 18% B and can be used as foliar nutrient. </li>
    <li>Solubor ( Na2B8O13.4H2O) is Di-Sodium octaborate tetrahydrate, contains 20.5% B. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>f) Molybdenum fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sodium Molybdate (Na2MoO4.2H2O) - contains 40% Mo.</li>
    <li>Ammonium Molybdate (NH4) 6Mo7O24.4H2O) - contains 54% Mo.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Speciality Fertilizers</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Potassium Schoenite: </strong></p>
<p>	 It provides a readily available supply of
Potassium, Magnesium and Sulphur to growing plants.
 Since three essential nutrients are contained
within a single particle, it helps in uniform
distribution of nutrients when it is spread in
the field.
 It contains 23% water soluble Potassium (as
K2O) and 11% Magnesium (as MgO).
 It provides an adequate supply of Sulphur
and because it is in the sulphate form, it
aids initial root growth, promotes seed
production and vigorous plant growth.
 Potassium Schoenite is readily water soluble,
has a neutral pH.
 It does not contribute to soil acidity or
alkalinity, unlike sources of Magnesium,
such as dolomite, which increases soil
pH and elemental Sulphur or ammonium
sulfate, which lower the soil pH.
 It is water soluble and suitable for fertigation
or foliar spray application. Being Chloride free, it is an ideal source of
K, Mg and S in cultivation of Chloride and
salt-sensitive crops such as fruits, vegetables,
Grapevines, Hops, Potatoes, Sunflowers,
Sugarcanes, and Tobacco.
 It is generally recommended at the rate of
50 kg per acre for soil application and 5-8
gm/ltr as foliar sprays at 15 days intervals
during flowering and fruiting stage.  </p>

<p><strong>Silicon Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>Silicon fertilizers are available both in liquid
and granular forms. Some liquid formulations contain Silica in
combination with Boron and Potassium.
 Plants absorb Silicon as silicate, which
gets deposited as Silica in the cell walls,
improving structural rigidity, strength and
erectness. Silicon is known to decrease susceptibility
to abiotic stresses, diseases and insect attacks.
 Silicon helps crops to increase tolerance to
Zinc deficiency and increases reproductive rate.</p>

<p><strong><em>Methods of Fertilizer Application</em></strong></p>
<p>The different methods of fertilizer application are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>1. Broadcasting</strong></p>
<p>It refers to spreading fertilizers uniformly all
over the field.
 Suitable for crops with dense stand and the
plant roots permeate the whole volume of
the soil.
 Large doses of fertilizers are applied and
insoluble phosphatic fertilizers such as rock
Phosphate are used</p>

<p><em>1.1. Broadcasting at sowing or planting (Basal application):</em></p>
<p>The main objective of broadcasting the
fertilizers at sowing time is to uniformly
distribute the fertilizer over the entire field
and to mix it with soil.</p>

<p><em>1.2. Top dressing:</em></p>
<p>It is broadcasting of fertilizers particularly
nitrogenous fertilizers in closely sown crops
like paddy and wheat, with the objective of
supplying Nitrogen in readily available form
to growing plants.</p>

<p><em>Disadvantages of broadcasting:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Nutrients cannot be fully utilized by plant roots as they move laterally over long distances.</li>
    <li>The weed growth is stimulated all over the field.</li>
    <li>Nutrients are fixed in the soil as they come in contact with a large mass of soil.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Placement</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the placing fertilizers in soil at a
specific place with or without reference to
the position of the seed. It is normally recommended when the
quantity of fertilizers to be applied is small,
development of the root system is poor,
soil has a low level of fertility and to apply
Phosphatic and Potassic fertilizers.</p>

<p><em>2.1 Plough sole placement:</em></p>
<p>In this method, fertilizer is placed at the
bottom of the plough furrow in a continuous
band during the process of ploughing.
 Every band is covered as the next furrow is
turned.
 This method is suitable for areas where soil
becomes quite dry up to few centimeters
below the soil surface and soils have a heavy
clay pan just below the plough sole layer.</p>

<p><em>2.2 Deep placement:</em></p>
<p>It is the placement of Ammoniacal
Nitrogenous fertilizers in the reduction zone
of soil particularly in paddy fields, where
Ammoniacal Nitrogen remains available to
the crop.
 This method ensures better distribution of
fertilizer in the root zone soil and prevents
loss of nutrients by run-off.</p>

<p><em>2.3 Localized placement:</em></p>
<p>It refers to the application of fertilizers into
the soil close to the seed or plant in order to
supply the nutrients in adequate amounts to
the roots of growing plants.
 The common methods to place fertilizers
close to the seed or plant are as follows:</p>

<p><em>2.3.1 Drilling:</em></p>
<p>In this method, fertilizer is applied at the
time of sowing by means of a seed-cumfertilizer drill.
 This places fertilizer and the seed in the
same row but at different depths.
 Although this method has been found
suitable for the application of Phosphatic
and Potassic fertilizers in cereal crops,
sometimes germination of seeds and young
plants may get damaged due to higher
concentration of soluble salts.</p>

<p><em>2.3.2 Side dressing:</em></p>
<p>It refers to the spread of fertilizer in between
the rows and around the plants. •	 Placement of Nitrogenous fertilizers by hand
in between the rows of crops like Maize,
Sugarcane, Cotton etc., to apply additional
doses of Nitrogen to the growing crops.
 Placement of fertilizers around the trees like
Mango,Apple, Grapes, Papaya, etc.</p>

<p><em>2.3.3 Band placement:</em></p>
<p>It refers to the placement of fertilizer in
bands. Band placement is of two types.</p>

<p><em>2.3.3.1 Hill placement:</em></p>
<p>It is practiced for the application of fertilizers
in orchards. In this method, fertilizers are
placed close to the plant in bands on one or
both sides of the plant.
 The length and depth of the band varies with
the nature of the crop.</p>

<p><em>2.3.3.2 Row placement:</em></p>
<p>When the crops like Sugarcane, Potato,
Cereals, etc., are sown close together in
rows, the fertilizer is applied in continuous
bands on one or both sides of the row, which
is known as row placement.</p>

<p><em>2.3.4 Pellet application:</em></p>
<p>It refers to the placement of Nitrogenous
fertilizer in the form of pellets 2.5 to 5 cm
deep between the rows of the paddy crop.
 The fertilizer is mixed with the soil in the
ratio of 1:10 and made into small pellets that
are deposited in the mud of paddy fields.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of placement of fertilizers:</strong></p>
<p>There is minimum contact between the soil and the fertilizer, and thus fixation of
nutrients is greatly reduced. Weeds all over the field cannot make use of
the fertilizers. Residual response of fertilizers is usually
higher. Utilization of fertilizers by the plants is higher.
 Loss of Nitrogen by leaching is reduced.
 Being immobile, Phosphates are better
utilized when placed.</p>

<p><strong>COMMON METHODS OF APPLYING LIQUID FERTILIZERS</strong></p>
<p><em>a) Starter solutions:</em></p>
<p>They are solutions of N, P2O5 and K2O in the ratio of 1:2:1 or 1:1:2 applied to young plants
at the time of transplanting, particularly in vegetables. Starter solutions help in rapid establishment
and quick growth of seedlings. Application of starter solutions requires
additional manpower and also results in higher fixation of Phosphate.</p>

<p><em>b) Foliar application:</em></p>
<p> Several nutrient elements are readily absorbed
by leaves when they are dissolved in water
and sprayed on them.
 Foliar application is effective for the
application of minor nutrients like Iron,
Copper, Boron, Zinc and Manganese.
 Insecticides may also be applied along with
fertilizers.
 The concentration of the spray solution has
to be carefully regulated to avoid serious
damage due to scorching of the leaves.</p>

<p><em>c) Fertigation:</em></p>
<p>It is a method of fertilizer application through
irrigation water by the drip system.
 Nutrients and water are supplied near
the active root zone resulting in greater
absorption by the crops.
 In this system fertilizer solution is distributed
evenly.
 Efficiency is high (80-90%) due to increased
availability of nutrients.
 In this method liquid fertilizer as well as water
soluble fertilizers are used.
 Fertigation saves water, fertilizer, time,
labour and energy substantially. </p>

<p>(i) N fertigation: </p>
<p>	 Urea, Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium
Sulphate, Calcium Ammonium Sulphate
and Calcium Ammonium Nitrate are used as
Nitrogenous fertilizers in fertigation.
 Urea is well suited for injection in micro
irrigation system.
 It is highly soluble and dissolves in nonionic form, and does not react with other
substances in the water.
 Urea does not cause precipitation problems.</p>

<p>(ii) P fertigation:</p>
<p>Application of Phosphorus to irrigation water
may cause precipitation of Phosphate salts.
 Phosphoric acid and Mono-Ammonium
Phosphate, Mono-Potassium Phosphate are
more suitable for fertigation. Phosphoric acid is inexpensive, provides
highest amount of Phosphorus and also
helps clean up the drip system. </p>

<p>(iii)K fertigation:</p>
<p>Application of K fertilizer does not cause any
precipitation of salts. Potassium Nitrate, Potassium Chloride,
Potassium Sulphate and Mono Potassium
Phosphate are used in drip fertigation.</p>

<p>(iv) Micro nutrients:</p>
<p>Fe, Manganese, Zinc, Copper, Boron and
Molybdenum can also be applied through
drip fertigation. Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo are also supplied
along with special fertilizers.</p>

<p><em>d) Injection into soil:</em></p>
<p>Liquid fertilizers for injection into the soil
may be of either pressure or non-pressure
type. Non-pressure solutions can be applied
either on the surface or in furrows without
appreciable loss of plant nutrients under
most conditions. Anhydrous Ammonia must be placed in
narrow furrows at a depth of 12-15 cm
and covered immediately to prevent loss of
Ammonia.</p>

<p><em>e) Aerial application:</em></p>
<p>In areas where ground application is not
practicable, the fertilizer solutions are applied
by aircraft particularly in hilly areas, forest
lands, grass lands or sugarcane fields, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Using Chemical Fertilizers</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Nutrients are soluble and available to the
plants almost immediately; therefore the effect is direct and fast.</li>
    <li>They are cheaper than organic manures. </li>
    <li>They are quite high in nutrient content,
and hence only relatively small amounts are required for crop growth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of Chemical Fertilizers:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The use of chemical fertilizers alone has not been helpful under intensive agriculture
because it aggravates soil degradation. </li>
    <li>The degradation is brought about by loss of organic matter, which consequently results in
soil acidity, nutrient imbalance and low crop yields.</li>
    <li>Due to its high solubility, up to 70% of inorganic fertilizer can be lost through
leaching, denitrification and erosion, reducing their effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Excessive application can result in negative effects such as pollution of water resources,
destruction of microorganisms and friendly insects, acidification or alkalization of the soil
or reduction in soil fertility.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Integrated Nutrient Management</strong></p>
<p>Integrated Nutrient Management refers
to the maintenance of soil fertility and of
plant nutrient supply at an optimum level for
sustaining the desired productivity through
optimization of the benefits from all possible
sources of organic, inorganic and biological
components in an integrated manner.</p>

<p><em>Concepts:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Regulated nutrient supply for optimum crop growth and higher productivity.</li>
    <li>Improvement and maintenance of soil fertility.</li>
    <li>Zero adverse impact on agro–ecosystem quality by balanced fertilization of organic manures, inorganic fertilizers and bioinoculant.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Determinants:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Nutrient requirement of cropping system as a whole.</li>
    <li>Soil fertility status and special management needs to overcome soil problems, if any.</li>
    <li>Availability of nutrients resources (organic, inorganic and biological sources)</li>
    <li>Economic condition of farmers and profitability of proposed INM option.</li>
    <li>Social acceptability.</li>
    <li>Ecological considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Advantages:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Enhances the availability of applied as well as native soil nutrients.</li>
    <li>Synchronizes the nutrient demand of the crop with nutrient supply from native and applied sources.</li>
    <li>Provides balanced nutrition to crops and minimizes the antagonistic effects resulting from hidden deficiencies and nutrient imbalance.</li>
    <li>Improves and sustains the physical, chemical and biological functioning of soil.</li>
    <li>Minimizes the deterioration of soil, water and ecosystem by promoting carbon sequestration, reducing nutrient losses to ground and surface water bodies and to atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Components:</em></p>
<p>Soil Source</p>
<p>Mobilizing unavailable nutrients
and adopting appropriate crop varieties, cultural
practices and cropping system.</p>
<p>Mineral Fertilizer</p>
<p>Super granules, coated
urea, direct use of locally available rock PO4 
in acid soils, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), MOP
and micronutrient fertilizers.</p>
<p>Organic Sources </p>
<p>By-products of farming and allied industries, FYM, droppings, crop
waste, residues, sewage, sludge, industrial waste, etc.</p>
<p>Biological Sources</p>
<p>Microbial inoculants to substitute 6 - 16 kg N/acre. (See under the
chapter on SOIL for more details).</p>

<p><strong>Law of the Minimum</strong></p>
<p>‘Law of the minimum’ states that if one of the
essential plant nutrients is deficient, plant growth
will be poor even when all other essential nutrients
are abundant.</p>
<p>Therefore a balanced supply of each and every
nutrient at its optimum level is important to realize
the complete potential of a particular crop.</p>

<p><strong>Fertilizer calculation</strong></p>
<p>The plant nutrients have to be supplied in
recommended proportions using straight or
compound fertilizers available commercially,
to achieve the anticipated yields.
 Hence, it is required to know the proportion
of each nutrient in the available fertilizer
and calculate the quantities to be applied to
achieve the required nutrient inputs.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>	In Tomato, to achieve a yield of 40 MT/
acre, the requirement of nutrients is 120 kg
of Nitrogen (N), 80 kg of Phosphorus (P2
O5) and 150 kg of Potassium (K2O). </p>
<p>When one intends to use DAP as the source
of Phosphorus and Urea as the source of
Nitrogen, fertilizer calculation is done as
below.</p>

<p><em>Step 1: Calculate the quantity of DAP required
to supply 80 kg Phosphorus.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Quantity of DAP is calculated first since it
is not only a source of Phosphorus, but also
contains Nitrogen.</li>
    <li>DAP contains 46% P2O5, i.e., 100 kg DAP contains 46 kg P2O5.</li>
    <li>So as to supply 80 kg P2O5, the quantity of DAP required is 100 x 80 46 = 173 kg DAP</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Step 2: Calculate the quantity of N supplied by
173 kg DAP</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>DAP also contains 18% Nitrogen </li>
    <li>Quantity of N supplied by 173 kg DAP is 173 x 18 100 = 31 kg N
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Step 3: Calculate the requirement of Urea to supply N.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Quantity of N recommended is 120 kg.</li>
    <li>Quantity supplied by 173 kg of DAP is 31 kg.</li>
    <li>Hence, remaining quantity of N to be supplied is (120-31) =89 kg.</li>
    <li>Quantity of Urea (46% N) required for supplying 81 kg N is 100 x 89 46 = 194 kg.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Step 4: Calculate the requirement of Potassic fertilizers to supply 150 kg Potasium.</em></p>
<p>a. When Muriate of Potash (60% K2O) is used Quantity of MOP required is 100 x 150 60 = 250 kg. </p>
<p>b. When Sulphate of Potash (50% K2O) is used Quantity of SOP required is 100 x 150 50 = 300 kg</p>
<p><strong>Thus the total requirement of fertilizers required to be applied is 173 kg DAP + 194 kg 
    Urea + 250 kg MOP / 300 kg SOP per acre of tomato crop. </strong></p>

<p>Similarly when Single Super Phosphate (SSP)
is used as source of Phosphorus, calculation is
done as follows:</p>

<p><em>Step 1: Calculate the quantity of SSP (16% P2O5) required to supply 80 Kg Phosphorus. </em></p>
<li>100 Kg SSP contains 16 Kg P2O5</li>
<li>So, to supply 80 Kg P2O5 the quantity of SSP required is 100 x 80 ÷16 = 500 Kg SSP.</li>


<p><em>Step 2: Calculate the requirement of Urea (46% N) to supply 120 Kg of N</em></p>
<p>100 x 120 46 =260.87 Kg </p>

<p><em>Step 3: Calculation of Potassium (K2O) remains same as in the previous case unless
other sources of Potassium like Potassium Nitrate or Mono Potassium Phosphate is used.</em></p>

<p>Thus the total fertilizers required to be applied
is 500 Kg SSP + 260.87 Kg Urea + 250 Kg
MOP or 300 Kg SOP per acre of tomato crop to
achieve 40 tons yield.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<li>SSP contains other nutrients like Calcium,
Sulphur and trace elements in addition to
Phosphorous.</li>
<li>Application of SSP helps improve soil
texture, water holding capacity, aeration, etc.</li>
<li>It is cheaper than other Phosphatic fertilizers.</li>
<li>Hence, SSP is should be preferred to DAP.</li>
